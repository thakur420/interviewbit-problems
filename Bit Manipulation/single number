/**
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example :
Input : [1 2 2 3 1]
Output : 3

int Solution::singleNumber(const vector<int> &A) {
    int result = A[0];
    for(int i = 1;i < A.size(); i++)
        result ^= A[i];
    return result;
